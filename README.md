## EfficientNetB3 Transfer Learning with Custom Top Layers

This repository contains code for fine-tuning the EfficientNetB3 model using transfer learning with custom top layers for classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset containing images from various classes and achieves high accuracy.

### Features:
- Utilizes transfer learning with EfficientNetB3 as the base model
- Custom top layers added for classification
- Trained on a dataset of images
- GPU acceleration for faster training
- Model evaluation on test data
- Trained model saved for future use

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Prepare your dataset and update the data loading code accordingly.
4. Run the training script to fine-tune the model.
5. Evaluate the trained model on test data.
6. Save the trained model for future use.

### Requirements:
- TensorFlow 2.x
- EfficientNetB3
- Other dependencies as specified in the code
